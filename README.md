# Building an Airflow Pipeline On AWS

### Project Description
#### I scrapped data from https://www.jobnet.com.mm/ using Python and embedded in Apache Airflow pipeline and stored the output csv files in AWS S3 Bucket then insert it into a Postgre DB to save historical data and serve as a data source for an analytic dashboard.

### Tools & AWS Services Used in this Project

#### For scripting language, I used python to utalize BS4, pandas and request libraries to extract publically available data from the jobnet.com website.
